# Shadfin -> App

# This project is not dead!
Hi all, things have gotten a little more busy lately, but rest assured I have not given up. In my free time I'm working on a compose multiplatform app for shadfin. This change while lengthy, will provide a better UI, Android & iOS apps, and a better more cohesive experience on ALL platforms. Thank you for putting your trust in me, and as always have a good day. 

## Disclaimer
This contains the source code for the web app. 
It may eventually be renamed to web, as I plan on making native alternatives at least for mobile devices.

## Demo
https://main.shadfin-standalone.pages.dev

## Self-Hosting
- Docker Image: See the [compose](https://github.com/Shadfin/app/blob/master/.docker/docker-compose.yml) file
- Artifact ZIP: Check the workflow tab and download one of the artifacts, this will let you host a completely static SPA.

## Warning
This is not a replacement for Jellyfin's existing web client and many features are missing or don't work.
